            'It always amuses me that the biggest praise for my work comes for the imagination, while the truth is that
            there's not a single line in all my work that does not have a basis in reality.
            The problem is that Caribbean reality resembles the wildest imagination.'
            From The Paris Review Interviews, Gabriel García Márquez, The Art of Fiction No. 69
            'All human beings have three lives: public, private, and secret.'
            Gabriel García Márquez: a Life
            'Fiction was invented the day Jonah arrived home and told his wife that he was three days late because he had been swallowed by a whale.'
            He recognised her despite the uproar, through his tears of unrepeatable sorrow at dying without her,
            and he looked at her for the last and final time with eyes more luminous, more grief-stricken,
            more grateful than she had ever seen them in half a century of a shared life,
            and he managed to say to her with his last breath: 'Only God knows how much I loved you.''
            Love in the Time of Cholera
            'Age has no reality except in the physical world. The essence of a human being is resistant to the passage of time. Our inner lives are eternal, which is to say that our spirits remain as youthful and vigorous as when we were in full bloom. Think of love as a state of grace, not the means to anything, but the alpha and omega. An end in itself.'
            Love in the Time of Cholera
            'I became aware that the invincible power that has moved the world is unrequited, not happy, love.'
            Memories of My Melancholy Whores
            'Nothing resembles a person as much as the way he dies.'
            Love in the Time of Cholera
            'My heart has more rooms in it than a whore house.'
            Love in the Time of Cholera
            'But when a woman decides to sleep with a man, there is no wall she will not scale, no fortress she will not destroy,
            no moral consideration she won't ignore at its very root: there's no God worth worrying about.'
            Love in the Time of Cholera
            'The problem in public life is learning to overcome terror; the problem in married life is learning to overcome boredom.'
            Love in the Time of Cholera
            'I don't believe in God, but I'm afraid of Him.'
            Love in the Time of Cholera
            'He soon acquired the forlorn look that one sees in vegetarians.'
            One Hundred Years of Solitude
            'If I knew that today would be the last time I’d see you, I would hug you tight and pray the Lord be the keeper of your soul.
            If I knew that this would be the last time you pass through this door, I’d embrace you, kiss you, and call you back for one more.
            If I knew that this would be the last time I would hear your voice, I’d take hold of each word to be able to hear it over and over again.
            If I knew this is the last time I see you, I’d tell you I love you, and would not just assume foolishly you know it already.'
